Stop shipping the SSR page/asset module island inside the background and integration-recovery function clones. Those entries overwrite `url.pathname` unconditionally before delegating to `main.mjs`, so they can never route to the page or asset handlers they inherited — yet Netlify zips and uploads every function separately, so the island was paid for on every deploy. The pruner walks the clone's real import graph (including backtick dynamic imports) and refuses to prune at all when a relative dynamic import cannot be resolved statically. Measured on calendar: total upload 42.2MB → 35.8MB.
