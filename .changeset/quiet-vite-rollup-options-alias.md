"@agent-native/core": patch

Stop the dev server from warning that the `agent-native-config` plugin set both `rollupOptions` and `rolldownOptions`. Vite 8 exposes `rollupOptions` as a getter alias of `rolldownOptions`, and spreading the incoming `build` / `optimizeDeps` sections copied that alias back out alongside our own `rolldownOptions`.
