Pause `useDbSync`, `useScreenRefreshKey`, `usePausingInterval`, and `useCollaborativeDoc` polling while the tab is hidden so background tabs do not keep waking the network. Restores polling on focus and visibility change. The new `pauseWhenHidden` option defaults to `true`; pass `false` to keep the legacy always-on behaviour.
