"@agent-native/core": patch

Read org-scoped settings with a prefix-scoped query instead of loading the whole settings table. `listOrgSettings` pulled and JSON-parsed every organization's rows into the caller to keep one org's, putting the entire deployment's settings table on the critical path of any org-scoped list read. `listSettingsByPrefix` is now exported from `@agent-native/core/settings` so apps can do the same for their own scoped reads.
