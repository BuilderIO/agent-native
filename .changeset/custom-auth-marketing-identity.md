Stop caller-supplied auth marketing from being overwritten by built-in localized copy. An app passing its own `marketing` whose `appName` matched a built-in slug (`Dispatch`, `Calendar`, …) had its tagline and features replaced by the stock localized copy in every non-English locale. A slug is now claimed only by content that actually matches the built-in entry.
