PR #511 follow-up fixes:

- `/runs/active` now surfaces recently-completed and recently-errored SQL runs (within a 10-minute reconnect window) so the agent-chat adapter can replay synthesized done/error events from the run-events stream instead of retrying the original POST when the producer's in-memory state was already evicted (different serverless isolate). Without this, a POST that failed after the server already accepted and finished the run could re-execute the agent turn and double-apply mutations.
- `/builder/status` now reads the user's active org via `getOrgContext(event)` and passes the orgId into `runWithRequestContext()` so the status poller resolves org-shared Builder credentials. Previously, an admin's org-scope OAuth result was invisible to every other org member's status poller, leaving the UI showing "not connected" even though chat resolved the credentials correctly.
- Registered secrets routes now treat `scope: "org"` as a first-class scope: writes and deletes require an active org and an owner/admin role (`canMutateOrgScope`), and `resolveScopeId("org", …)` rejects requests without an active org rather than falling back to a `solo:` scopeId. Ad-hoc secret routes were already restricted to `user`/`workspace` and remain unchanged.
