"@agent-native/core": patch
---

Fixes for feedback from QA pass:

- **Content** (`templates/content`): deleting the page you're currently viewing now navigates to the landing page **before** the delete round-trip resolves, so the editor doesn't sit on a now-deleted page while the request is in flight. The page-id route also redirects to `/` when the document fetch returns 404, so refreshing on a stale URL no longer dead-ends at "Document not found".
- **Design** (`templates/design`): clicking the Edit tab no longer auto-collapses the agent chat. Previously, entering edit mode dispatched `agent-panel:close` so the EditPanel and canvas could share the screen, but the chat dropping out shifted the toolbar and removed the user's working context. Properties and chat now coexist as adjacent right-side panels.
- **OrgSwitcher** (`packages/core`): clicking "Create organization" or "Invite member" now clears any leftover input from a previous session before entering that mode. Previously, the create form could re-open prefilled with the just-created org's name, making the switcher look like a create dialog for the new org.
