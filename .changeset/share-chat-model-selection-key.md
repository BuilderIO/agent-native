Derive the chat model selection localStorage key through one exported helper, `chatModelSelectionStorageKey`. `useChatModels` takes the raw key while `MultiTabAssistantChat` takes only the namespace suffix, so a hero composer that passed the same string to both wrote to a different key than the chat beside it and never saw its model picks.
