 * 500s every query touching a pre-existing production table, and two
 * branches extending the same migration list with colliding version numbers
 * can silently drop one branch's DDL.
 *
 * This walks every Drizzle table exported from schema.ts and asserts every
 * declared SQL column name appears somewhere in the migrations source
 * (db.ts) — either in the table's original `CREATE TABLE` or in a later
 * `ADD COLUMN` migration. It can't prove *ordering* (a column could still be
 * referenced only in a comment), but it catches the exact failure mode here:
 * a schema column with zero mentions in the migration history.

 * source (matching the exact object-literal shape this file uses: `version:`
 * immediately followed, a few lines later, by an optional `name: "..."`) and

 * naming ALL of them would make every one of those migrations re-apply by
 * name on every existing database, which is only safe if every single one of
 * those older SQL statements is idempotent. That has not been verified here,
