## 0.165.3

### Patch Changes

- b6ca1a7: Warn when `GOOGLE_SIGN_IN_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` name different Google clients. Sign-in silently preferred the sign-in pair, so repairing `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` on a deploy that also set `GOOGLE_SIGN_IN_CLIENT_SECRET` changed nothing while appearing correct.
- b6ca1a7: Harden MCP OAuth reconnects for mounted apps, legacy settings, and concurrent updates.
- b6ca1a7: Ensure prebuilt Netlify workspace deployments include the hosted feedback URL.

## 0.165.2

### Patch Changes

- b130f4e: Keep app changelogs compact while preserving folder-backed history in the in-app What's new surface.
- ac3acfa: Improve provider failure recovery and remove the retired Videos template from Dispatch app creation.

Older releases are archived in [changelog/archive/CHANGELOG.md](./changelog/archive/CHANGELOG.md).

## 0.165.1

### Patch Changes

- 43ef3a8: Fix reconnecting existing OAuth-backed MCP servers in place.

## 0.165.0

### Minor Changes

- b39f22c: Stop regex lookaround from 400ing the whole model turn, and give three
  always-on core kits a `frameworkTools` switch.
  - `stripUnsupportedSchemaKeywords` now drops a `pattern` containing lookaround
    (`(?=`, `(?!`, `(?<=`, `(?<!`). Anthropic rejects it with "regex lookaround is
    not supported" and rejects the entire request, so one such tool takes every
    other tool in the payload down with it — visible as an error in chat, and as
    nothing at all in a background run. `z.string().email()` compiles to two
    negative lookaheads and appears in ~35 action schemas, so this is answered at
    the boundary every tool passes through, alongside the existing typeless-schema
    and unsupported-`format` rewrites. The action's own zod schema still validates
    the value, so nothing that was enforced is loosened.
  - `emailCatalog`, `workspaceUserGroups`, and `orgServiceTokens` are new
    `frameworkTools` groups covering twelve actions that previously had no switch.
    All three default to on, so the available surface is unchanged — but they are
    now tagged, which takes them out of every app's default first-request tool
    list and leaves them reachable through `tool-search`.
  - `mcp.catalog: "app"` alongside `mcp.connectorCatalog` now throws at plugin
    init. `catalog: "app"` short-circuits the connector tier, so the two together
    served the app's full registry while the allow-list sat in the config looking
    authoritative.

### Patch Changes

- 483f03d: Stop the run-level no-progress backstop from killing runs while the model is
  still generating. Two watchdogs guarded the same silence on different clocks:
  the agent loop's `lastModelStreamProgressAt` bumps on every engine frame, while
  the run manager's backstop only sees events the loop forwards. Extended thinking
  produces the first without the second, so the 150s bound sat inside the working
  distribution — runs whose worst gap crossed it were checkpointed as
  `auto_continue { reason: "no_progress" }` and recorded as errors while still
  streaming, some missing by a single second, and background automations discarded
  results the agent went on to finish minutes later.

  The agent loop now brackets each engine call with a `model_stream` start/end
  pair, and the run manager counts it exactly like `tool_start`/`tool_done`: an
  engine call in flight suspends the backstop, bounded by the loop's own 90s
  model-stream watchdog the same way a tool call is bounded by its own timeout.
  Keepalives still do not count as progress, so a wedged transport with no engine
  call in flight trips the backstop as before.

  Background automation failures now also report through `captureError`. Both
  callers — the recurring-jobs scheduler and the trigger dispatcher — recorded the
  failure onto the automation's own metadata and logged it, and neither reported
  it, so a cut-off automation was visible only in a resource field and stdout.

  A cut-off run now reports a terminal state instead of none. `runAgentLoop`
  returns early at an `auto_continue` checkpoint and never reaches its outcome
  classification, so a truncated run shipped `terminal_state` and `error_message`
  as null and the reason was recoverable only from `agent_run_events`. Unplanned
  boundaries (`no_progress`, `stream_ended`, `gateway_timeout`, …) now surface as a
  retryable failure carrying the reason as the terminal code, while the planned
  `run_timeout` chunk boundary — which a hosted foreground run hits roughly every
  40s by design — records its reason without counting as an error.

## 0.164.26

### Patch Changes

- d5ceae9: Preserve the beta environment opt-out when custom authentication pages are served.

## 0.164.25

### Patch Changes

- 562194a: Stop sending `temperature` on model requests that carry Claude thinking. Effort
  defaults to High on every reasoning-capable Claude model, so internal callers
  that asked only for `temperature: 0` — the Observational Memory compactor, eval
  judges, sentiment inference — always got a 400 ("`temperature` may only be set
  to 1 when thinking is enabled or in adaptive mode"). The Anthropic, AI SDK, and
  Builder gateway engines now drop the sampling parameters when thinking is on or
  when the model family removed them, and Observational Memory compaction runs at
  low effort so thinking cannot consume its whole output budget.

## 0.164.24

### Patch Changes

- 14a3f87: Preserve the beta environment opt-out when custom authentication pages are served.
- 14a3f87: Keep BYOA sign-in and liveness routes available while unrelated serverless bootstrap work is waiting on the database.
