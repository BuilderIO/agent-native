# @agent-native/core

## 0.12.34

### Patch Changes

- d749754: Drop the command menu from `top-[5vh]` to `top-[15vh]` so the palette sits comfortably below the page header instead of pinned to the top.
- d749754: Top-align command palettes so result count changes do not shift their viewport position.

## 0.12.33

### Patch Changes

- 9e11b24: Drop the command menu from `top-[5vh]` to `top-[15vh]` so the palette sits comfortably below the page header instead of pinned to the top.
- 9e11b24: Top-align command palettes so result count changes do not shift their viewport position.

## 0.12.32

### Patch Changes

- 8a83abd: Use redirect sign-in inside Builder.io desktop and harden Builder Google popup opening.
- 8a83abd: Move the extensions sidebar explainer from a click popover to an interactive hovercard.

## 0.12.31

### Patch Changes

- 88f206f: Open workspace settings to the relevant settings section and update chat history wording.
- 88f206f: Extract the QuestionFlow primitive from the design / videos / slides templates into a shared `GuidedQuestionFlow` (plus `useGuidedQuestionFlow` hook and helpers `formatGuidedAnswerValue`, `formatGuidedAnswersForAgent`, `getOtherGuidedAnswerText`, `hasGuidedAnswer`, `isOtherGuidedAnswer`, `makeOtherGuidedAnswer`, `normalizeGuidedAnswers`). Templates that need question-driven generation can now consume the same component instead of forking ~400 lines of UI each.
- 88f206f: Improve agent chat tool-call detail display and disable lazy route-discovery manifest polling in template configs.
- 88f206f: Stamp `requestMode` on every assistant chunk's metadata so the chat surface can tell which mode each turn was actually generated under. The Plan-mode "Implement Plan" CTA now requires the latest assistant message to be a plan response, instead of triggering on any assistant message while the global toggle is plan. Also let the chat history popover include currently-open tabs (marked "Open" instead of a timestamp) so users see their full thread list.
- 88f206f: Prevent copying public-only share links before the resource is public.
- 88f206f: Await persistence of terminal run events before writing the final run status, and skip the status update if the terminal-event SQL write fails — so reconnects can no longer observe `status='errored'` without the corresponding error payload, and the heartbeat-stale reaper retries the run cleanly. Also forces the settings panel to re-apply `initialSection` when the same value is requested twice via a new `sectionRequestKey` prop, and updates the dev overlay shortcut hint to render `Cmd+Ctrl+A` on Mac and `Ctrl+Alt+A` elsewhere.
- 88f206f: Add an optional `id` prop on `SettingsSection` so callers can deep-link or scroll to a specific section. The `agent-panel:open-settings` CustomEvent now accepts an optional `detail.section` field that AgentPanel forwards to the settings panel as `initialSection`. Rename the chat-history toggle copy to "All chats".
- 88f206f: Persist terminal agent-run events before final run status updates so reconnects replay the real outcome.
- 88f206f: Stream `/_agent-native/events` SSE for in-process change events as the fast path for `useDbSync`, with the existing `/_agent-native/poll` endpoint as the cross-process / serverless fallback. When the SSE stream is connected, the polling interval relaxes to 15 s; if the server can't reach the client (or the consumer passes `sseUrl: false`), polling continues at the original cadence. Tool-call cards in `AssistantChat` now expose copy-to-clipboard buttons on the input and result panes.
- 88f206f: Open the agent settings panel when selecting Workspace settings from the organization switcher.

## 0.12.30

### Patch Changes

- 419988f: Surface a visible "model returned an empty response" message when an engine ends a turn with reasoning-only content and zero output text (e.g. OpenAI gpt-5+ Responses runs where reasoning consumes the entire output-token budget). Previously the SSE stream finished cleanly with no text, producing a silent empty assistant bubble.
- 419988f: Add an optional `prepareRequest` hook on `ProductionAgentOptions` and `AgentChatPluginOptions` so templates can normalize the inbound chat request — materialize uploaded attachments into per-template file handles, rewrite the message, or append non-visible instructions — between owner resolution and system/context assembly. Re-export `AgentChatAttachment` from the core entry points so templates can type the hook's payload.
- 419988f: Add a server-side agent chat request preparation hook for templates to materialize uploaded attachments before a run starts.

## 0.12.29

### Patch Changes

- 4c90b33: Use Claude Sonnet as the default Builder gateway chat model.

## 0.12.28

### Patch Changes

- fd1cc43: Add Google OAuth handoff debug breadcrumbs for Builder-hosted sign-in flows.
- fd1cc43: Pause `useDbSync`, `useScreenRefreshKey`, `usePausingInterval`, and `useCollaborativeDoc` polling while the tab is hidden so background tabs do not keep waking the network. Restores polling on focus and visibility change. The new `pauseWhenHidden` option defaults to `true`; pass `false` to keep the legacy always-on behaviour. Also expand `useDbSync`'s default invalidation set to include `app-state`, `navigate-command`, `show-questions`, and `__set_url__`, so framework-managed application-state keys stay in sync without templates having to opt in by passing `queryKeys`. The `/_agent-native/poll` endpoint now subscribes to in-process `app-state` and `settings` emitters and records changes directly, skipping a DB scan when the event happened on the same Node instance, and forwards an `owner` field on every event so clients can match it to the active session.
- fd1cc43: Allow per-message plan/act override via `runConfig.custom.requestMode` so the chat composer can flip a single user turn into Implement Plan without changing the global Plan/Act toggle.

## 0.12.27

### Patch Changes

- 08d4113: Broaden composer upload filters so Markdown, JSON, CSV, DOCX, and PPTX reference files are selectable in native file pickers.
- 08d4113: Buffer streamed assistant text until the final-response guard approves it, so rejected answers never flash before the corrective retry. Removes the `clear` event the UI used to swallow.
- 08d4113: Improve assistant chat embed previews and sub-agent task card labels.
- 08d4113: Clear stale chat activity when corrective agent retries discard partial output.
- 08d4113: Add Preview header bar to IframeEmbed showing the embed's title above the iframe.
- c195ddd: Include installed libsql native packages in Node serverless bundles so hosted apps do not fail loading local SQLite/libsql fallbacks.
- 08d4113: Use better-sqlite3 for local SQLite file URLs and `@libsql/client/web` for remote libsql/Turso URLs so serverless bundles no longer depend on libsql's platform-specific native packages. The deploy bundler still copies any installed `@libsql/<platform>` natives into Netlify/Vercel/Lambda outputs as a safety net.
- 08d4113: Bundle agent chat feedback controls with the main client entry so missing lazy chunks cannot crash the agent panel.
- 08d4113: Show visible assistant error text for chat authentication failures instead of blank messages.

## 0.12.26

### Patch Changes

- 09d9748: Bundle agent chat feedback controls with the main client entry so missing lazy chunks cannot crash the agent panel.

## 0.12.25

### Patch Changes

- 1155964: Close Google OAuth success popups after Builder workspace sign-in completes.
- 1155964: Keep hosted chat credential isolation intact and show visible missing-credential errors.
- 1155964: Read legacy workspace-scoped Builder credentials so users who connected before org scoping no longer see "missing key" errors.

## 0.12.24

### Patch Changes

- d198100: Polish setup, navigation, editor, and feedback affordances from user feedback.
- d198100: Preserve chat attachments and completed history during interrupted-run recovery.
- d198100: Fix stale collaboration presence cleanup, stale run handling, and agent panel recovery.

## 0.12.23

### Patch Changes

- e752afd: Expire stale progress runs so abandoned tray indicators do not stay active forever.
- e752afd: Require request-scoped Builder or LLM credentials for signed-in users on hosted shared-database apps.
- e752afd: Use neutral composer styling when Plan mode is active.
- e752afd: Contain failed remote MCP handshakes and show concise connection errors.
- e752afd: Quiet the optional node-pty missing notice unless terminal debug logging is enabled.
- e752afd: Keep the Workspace docs tooltip from overlapping the panel header.
- e752afd: Improve Sentry signal for Builder gateway network failures and browser analytics noise.
- e752afd: Use the request-context owner when resolving explicit agent engine credentials.
- e752afd: Preserve uploaded attachments on queued chat messages and stringify screen context objects.

## 0.12.22

### Patch Changes

- 1ba9738: Allow composer dictation to request same-origin microphone access and improve blocked-microphone guidance.
- 1ba9738: Use the AI SDK's default OpenAI Responses path for first-party OpenAI agent models.
- 1ba9738: Show a Builder reconnect action when agent chat hits Builder or model-provider auth errors.

## 0.12.21

### Patch Changes

- 0d95d53: Restore production Plan mode in the agent sidebar and clarify read-only planning before production writes.
- 0d95d53: Fix prompt composer model selection in embedded prompt dialogs.
- 0d95d53: Add generic client/server error capture helpers and report agent chat run failures through configured capture providers.

## 0.12.20

### Patch Changes

- 715eda8: Fix sidebar popover clipping, terminal startup visibility, automation test routing, and tiny usage rounding.
- 715eda8: Add Vercel workspace deploy packaging and make the shared-token login gate provider-neutral.
- 715eda8: Reduce noisy CLI Sentry reports for handled workspace watcher limits and skip first-party agent symlinks during GitHub tarball extraction on Windows.
- 715eda8: Collect browser and server Sentry errors from shared DSN deploy configuration.
- 715eda8: Add `vercel` as a third workspace-deploy preset alongside `cloudflare_pages` and `netlify`. When `preset=vercel`, the build emits into `.vercel/output` so the standard Vercel build pipeline picks it up unmodified.

## 0.12.19

### Patch Changes

- 3b88628: Disable Plan mode in local browser dev surfaces and point users to Agent Native Desktop for planning.
- 3b88628: Use cross-site session cookie attributes for Google OAuth sessions so embedded app chat remains authenticated.
- 3b88628: Default the framework to the Builder gateway's `gpt-5-5` model alias, centralize built-in engine model defaults/catalogs in `model-config.ts`, and stop hard-coding `DEFAULT_MODEL` for A2A / MCP / integrations runs — the resolved engine's default is used instead. Also adds a "Use Builder" cloud CTA alongside the Desktop CTA in the AgentPanel and CodeRequiredDialog code-access-unavailable surfaces, including a `useBuilderConnectUrl()` hook that wires up the secondary link from `/_agent-native/builder/status`.
- 3b88628: Fix lazy workspace dev root routing, live app discovery, and generated app dependency startup.
- 3b88628: Keep oversized pasted-text chat attachments from overflowing agent context and render them consistently as pasted-text chips.

## 0.12.18

### Patch Changes

- c17f651: Reorder agent-engine resolution so a Builder-connected user always wins over a stale settings row. Add `isStoredEngineUsableForRequest` so per-user `app_secrets` (Builder or BYOK) are recognized when deciding whether a stored engine is usable, and update `/agent-engine/status` and the engine picker to honor the same priority chain at request time.
- c17f651: Polish OAuth callback close-tab success and error page spacing.

## 0.12.17

### Patch Changes

- ad7006d: Block frame-routed code submissions when local source access is unavailable and point users to Agent Native Desktop for code, CLI, and Workspace access.
- ad7006d: Keep workspace app creation prompts editable after submit and clarify that named products are design references, not implied API-key requirements.
- ad7006d: Fix Plan mode selector mouse interaction and remove keyboard-shortcut wording from user-facing mode guidance.
- ad7006d: Suppress benign Vite connection-reset error overlays and keep narrow composer controls contained.

## 0.12.16

### Patch Changes

- 27c3dbc: Submit a pending email invite when closing the share popover with Done.
- 27c3dbc: Clarify provider-specific tool routing so named external sources win over generic warehouse tools.
- 27c3dbc: Improve chat run completion durability and clarify mounted workspace app routing.
- 27c3dbc: Preserve public forwarded host/protocol headers when proxying workspace apps so Google OAuth redirect URIs use the stable gateway origin instead of internal app dev ports.

## 0.12.15

### Patch Changes

- b07f933: Export the Builder agent engine for template media pipelines.
- b07f933: Clarify workspace app creation instructions to reuse hosted first-party apps as A2A neighbors instead of cloning or nesting templates.
- b07f933: Make extension removal handle shared extensions and refresh installed widgets cleanly.

## 0.12.14

### Patch Changes

- 5115f28: Add Dispatch knowledge packs to workspace resources and let new-app flows grant them alongside vault keys.
- 5115f28: Add an optional run-local command CTA to auth marketing pages.
- 5115f28: Retry workspace app dev servers after early launch failures during local app creation.

## 0.12.13

### Patch Changes

- b1595cc: Allow Builder Connect to override deploy-level Builder credentials with request-scoped credentials.
- b1595cc: Improve Builder transcription error detail and remove OpenAI-specific fallback guidance.

## 0.12.12

### Patch Changes

- 4caaa4f: Keep workspace app creation on same-origin gateway routes and stop child dev servers from advertising private ports.
- 4caaa4f: Give the extensions empty state more breathing room.

## 0.12.11

### Patch Changes

- e076977: Hide the share dialog notification checkbox until an email invite is entered.
- e076977: Match the share popover and trigger surfaces to app sidebar backgrounds.
- e076977: Surface tool-input progress in agent chat and recover from stale reconnect streams.
- e076977: Make generated workspace apps preserve their mounted base path and keep Dispatch app links on the active workspace gateway origin.
- e076977: Support stable root OAuth callbacks for path-mounted workspace apps and clarify new-app prompts.

## 0.12.10

### Patch Changes

- f0776fc: Decode extension route path segments so extensionData removal works for item IDs with spaces.
- f0776fc: Keep short pasted text inline in the agent composer and only convert page-sized pastes to attachments.
- f0776fc: Keep agent chat auth prompts scoped to the originating chat and surface streamed provider auth errors as run errors.
- f0776fc: Preserve structured tool history across agent chat recovery turns and suppress duplicate read-only calls during continuations.

## 0.12.9

### Patch Changes

- 7a849c3: Give the shared extensions sidebar header room for its full label and replace the docs icon tooltip with an interactive popover.
- 7a849c3: Include the Images app as a default connected A2A agent and guide agents to use it for generated imagery.
- 7a849c3: Images-template library refactor + agent-discovery polish.
- 7a849c3: Remember extension sidebar usage and add collapsible sort controls.

## 0.12.8

### Patch Changes

- fdf8cfc: Align the agent sidebar toggle button with standard top-bar icon controls.

## 0.12.7

### Patch Changes

- 7d0ebfc: Add Builder-managed image generation onboarding support and endpoint helpers.
- 7d0ebfc: Move Mail lower in template pickers, remove non-featured templates from default selections, and add a hosted Mail Google sign-in notice.
- 7d0ebfc: Preserve standard `backdrop-filter` declarations in production CSS builds.
- 7d0ebfc: Allow share dialogs to customize visibility and link copy for template-specific access wording.

## 0.12.6

### Patch Changes

- 471bf1e: Treat invalid chat session tokens as auth failures and make empty command-menu AI prompts open chat.
- 471bf1e: Show Builder.io LLM usage as agent credit spend when Builder is the active provider.
- 471bf1e: Harden agent chat auth and gateway recovery paths.
- 471bf1e: Keep programmatic new-tab chat sends on the requested thread id so UI callers can track run state.
- 471bf1e: Allow the feedback popover's first submit click to load the form schema before sending.
- 471bf1e: Persist the agent chat model selection across page refreshes.
- 471bf1e: Allow notification bells to show clearer empty-state copy.
- 471bf1e: Add optional share notification controls and direct resource links for sharing emails.

## 0.12.5

### Patch Changes

- 2e99cca: Fix workspace scaffolding for the Design template and clarify local Dispatch setup.
- 2e99cca: Shorten the composer model selector reasoning effort label.
- 2e99cca: Send Builder gateway owner headers from the Builder agent engine and keep Builder auth failures out of the app-login flow.
- 2e99cca: Register the `images` template with `hidden:true` in the CLI catalog. The template directory exists in-flight but is intentionally not surfaced in public template lists yet.

## 0.12.4

### Patch Changes

- e2bce24: Keep the prompt composer TipTap schema minimal to avoid ProseMirror recursion in deployed pages.
- e2bce24: Keep existing extension edits on the update-extension path instead of routing them to Builder code changes.
- e2bce24: Recover dev pages when Vite serves outdated optimized dependency 504 responses.

## 0.12.3

### Patch Changes

- d83d5ec: Recognize Images artifacts in cross-app A2A responses.
- d83d5ec: Improve the shared access-token login page with clearer guidance and visible failure states.

## 0.12.2

### Patch Changes

- b878dd8: `agentNative.chatRunning` event now reflects both true and false transitions of `isRunning`, allowing UI consumers to track agent work state in real time.
- b878dd8: Broadcast agent chat running state when normal runs start or stop, and switch the agent panel back to chat when submitting a visible prompt.

## 0.12.1

### Patch Changes

- 47b8486: Avoid duplicate TipTap link extensions when editors provide custom link behavior.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 14f7b63: Add agent-callable extension list, hide, unhide, and delete actions so chat can manage visible extensions without raw SQL.

### Patch Changes

- 14f7b63: Tighten generic chat document uploads and make restored chat threads settle at the bottom after refresh.
- 14f7b63: Collapse the extension sidebar list to three items by default.
- 14f7b63: Clarify personal versus organization MCP server scope guidance in the connection UI.
- 14f7b63: Create extensions with private visibility even when the creator belongs to an organization.

## 0.11.4

### Patch Changes

- 24781d0: Clarify Dispatch new-app instructions so Builder branches scaffold separate workspace apps instead of editing starter.
- 24781d0: Add a template hook for retrying guarded final agent answers before they are shown.
- 24781d0: Match the agent sidebar loading header height to the loaded panel header.

## 0.11.3

### Patch Changes

- 81d5b68: Use the Tabler message-dots icon for the agent sidebar toggle.
- 81d5b68: Keep agent DB tools scoped to owner rows when org context is active and rows have no org id.
- 81d5b68: Suppress automatic stale route-chunk reloads inside the Agent Native desktop app.
- 81d5b68: Harden the public-viewer anonymous-owner resolver: validate Referer origin, require the exact Builder callback path, and discard expired status connect URLs in the embedded settings panel.

## 0.11.2

### Patch Changes

- 8975a96: Allow Builder connect popups to complete from local embedded settings panels by accepting a short-lived signed connect token.
- 8975a96: Polish agent chat menus, icons, and message timestamps.
- 8975a96: Add share-link support to the share button and allow templates to expose read-only anonymous chat and Builder-connect surfaces.

## 0.11.1

### Patch Changes

- 2d52595: Detect Builder preview webviews from builder preview URL markers so code prompts route to Builder chat.
- 2d52595: Use the shadcn popover animation for the framework share control and keep visibility changes fresh after reopening.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- b4bdd34: Workspace settings reachable from the org switcher in every template, plus admin-vs-member roles, bulk invite (typed list, paste-many, CSV upload) with per-row role selection, and stricter auto-join domain validation (must match the admin's own email domain; free email providers like gmail.com are blocked).
  - `OrgSwitcher` exposes a "Workspace settings" link (configurable via `settingsPath`, default `/team`).
  - `useInviteMember` accepts `{ email, role }`; new `useBulkInviteMembers` and `useChangeMemberRole` hooks.
  - New `PUT /_agent-native/org/members/:email/role` endpoint; only owners can promote/demote admins.
  - `org_invitations` gains a `role` column so invites land at the assigned role on accept.
  - `OrgPendingInvitation` type now includes `role`.
  - New `isFreeEmailProvider` export with a curated blocklist used by `setDomainHandler`.

### Patch Changes

- b4bdd34: Replace custom overflow menu in extensions sidebar with shadcn DropdownMenu (Radix-portaled). Fixes the menu being clipped by the sidebar's stacking context and adds the standard fade/zoom animations.
- b4bdd34: Sign connected-agent A2A mention calls with the current request identity in production.
- b4bdd34: Fix Cloudflare Pages deploy failure with `Cannot require: tty`. Terminal-detection helpers in transitive deps (chalk, picocolors, supports-color, debug, etc.) call `require("tty")` at module init; the bundled-worker require shim now covers `tty`, `readline`, `process`, `console`, `perf_hooks`, and `string_decoder` so those CJS calls resolve to the matching ESM imports instead of throwing at deploy time.
- b4bdd34: Allow actions to stop an agent turn after deterministic provider failures instead of feeding the error back into automatic retries.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 721f125: NotificationsBell: clicking a notification with `metadata.link` now navigates to that URL (and marks the notification read). Notifications without a link keep the previous click-to-mark-read-only behavior.

### Patch Changes

- 977af2b: Restyle the Builder connect callback / error pages to match the rest of the framework's UI — Inter font, neutral-zinc palette, and dark/light mode that follows the user's app theme (or `prefers-color-scheme`).
- a562b18: Fix extension table initialization and respect reduced-motion preferences on first-run onboarding backgrounds.
- a562b18: Improve chat stop/error fallback copy and normalize escaped tooltip shortcuts.
- 57b7e0a: Composer accepts file drops directly. Previously, dragging a file (PDF, PPTX, image, etc.) into the prompt composer triggered the browser's default behavior (navigating to the file), even though the "+" button accepted the same file types. The composer now intercepts drops, mirroring the existing paste handler — drag a deck or screenshot in and it attaches like a normal upload.
- 57b7e0a: PromptComposer now inlines small text files (`.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.yaml`, etc., plus any `text/*` MIME) into the prompt as `<uploaded-text-file>` blocks instead of only attaching them as binary uploads. Truncates after 60k characters. The original file is still attached as well, so server-side handlers that prefer the binary path keep working.
- 57b7e0a: Resolve org-shared Builder credentials when auto-selecting the chat engine.
- a562b18: Fix queued chat handoff after a run completes and improve multi-invite banner spacing.
- a562b18: Detect Netlify Lambda runtimes for hosted agent soft timeouts and cap repeated stale-run recovery loops.
- a562b18: Fix Vite "Failed to resolve import @tauri-apps/api/core" error in fresh CLI workspaces. The settings panel called `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke` directly instead of dynamically importing `@tauri-apps/api/core`, so non-desktop installs no longer crash on the first SPA load.
- 57b7e0a: Wrap shadcn `Tooltip` usages in a `TooltipProvider` so the agent panel and other top-level components don't crash on render. PR #509 swapped native `title` hints for `Tooltip`, but `@radix-ui/react-tooltip@1.2.x` requires a provider ancestor and threw `'Tooltip' must be used within 'TooltipProvider'` on the docs site and any template embedding the agent sidebar.
- 977af2b: Route Dispatch overview prompts to Builder chat in Builder frames and keep the app agent sidebar collapsed there by default.
- a562b18: Improve workspace setup feedback and allow adding the Dispatch workspace app from the CLI.
- a562b18: Fix completed chat runs getting restored as permanently thinking after partial thread saves.
- a562b18: Server-side Sentry now attaches user/org context to more error paths. Failed login/signup attempts capture as `level:warning` with `tags.auth:login|signup` and the attempted email pinned to `user.email` (filtered to skip routine bad-credential noise). Every `runWithRequestContext({ userEmail, orgId, ... })` invocation now also tags Sentry's per-request isolation scope, so action handlers, agent-chat tool re-entries, integration webhook processors, and A2A calls all surface errors under the right user even when no session cookie was attached to the request.
- 57b7e0a: Stop reloading the agent chat after Builder or secret configuration updates.
- 57b7e0a: Initialize Sentry inside the Nitro server so 5xx errors thrown by framework routes, action handlers, and agent-chat streams are reported with per-request user context. Driven by the `SENTRY_SERVER_DSN` env var (no-op when unset). Complements the existing CLI and browser Sentry init points without wiring them together — each maps to a different Sentry project.
- a562b18: Improve shared extension shell navigation, creation guidance, and polling recovery.
- a562b18: Recover automatically from no-detail Builder gateway errors in agent chat.
- 57b7e0a: Unify request-scoped secret resolution to read user → org → workspace rows from `app_secrets` everywhere. Previously, `getOwnerApiKey()`, `resolveSecret()`, voice provider status, transcribe-voice, and Google Realtime each had their own slightly different read order — some only checked the user row, some checked user + org but not workspace. They now all walk the same chain, so an org-shared (or workspace-scoped) key is honored consistently no matter which call site resolves it. Solo (no-org) sessions fall back to a `workspace:solo:<email>` row.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 4090a2a: PR #511 follow-up fixes:
  - `/runs/active` now surfaces recently-completed and recently-errored SQL runs (within a 10-minute reconnect window) so the agent-chat adapter can replay synthesized done/error events from the run-events stream instead of retrying the original POST when the producer's in-memory state was already evicted (different serverless isolate). Without this, a POST that failed after the server already accepted and finished the run could re-execute the agent turn and double-apply mutations.
  - `/builder/status` now reads the user's active org via `getOrgContext(event)` and passes the orgId into `runWithRequestContext()` so the status poller resolves org-shared Builder credentials. Previously, an admin's org-scope OAuth result was invisible to every other org member's status poller, leaving the UI showing "not connected" even though chat resolved the credentials correctly.
  - Registered secrets routes now treat `scope: "org"` as a first-class scope: writes and deletes require an active org and an owner/admin role (`canMutateOrgScope`), and `resolveScopeId("org", …)` rejects requests without an active org rather than falling back to a `solo:` scopeId. Ad-hoc secret routes were already restricted to `user`/`workspace` and remain unchanged.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 117d476: Builder credentials are now stored at org scope by default when an owner/admin connects, so a single OAuth flow powers AI chat for everyone in that org.
  - New `app_secrets` scope: `"org"` (alongside `"user"` and `"workspace"`).
  - `writeBuilderCredentials(email, creds, { orgId, role })` writes at `scope: "org"` when the connecting user is owner/admin of an active org. Plain members (or users in Personal mode) keep writing at `scope: "user"` so a teammate can never overwrite the org-shared connection. The Builder OAuth callback now passes `orgId`+`role` automatically — existing direct callers without options keep their previous user-scope behaviour.
  - `resolveBuilderCredential` and `resolveSecret` now check user scope first, then fall back to the active org's row. `${env.BUILDER_PRIVATE_KEY}` (deploy-managed mode) still wins over both, unchanged.
  - `deleteBuilderCredentials(email, { orgId, role })` mirrors the connect-side scope decision, so a Disconnect press undoes exactly what the same user's Connect press wrote — no orphaned org-shared rows for owners, no accidental org-wide tear-downs from a member's personal disconnect.
  - Helper `resolveCredentialWriteScope(email, orgId, role)` exposes the scope decision for any future credentials integration that wants the same default-to-org-when-admin behaviour.

  Migration: existing per-user Builder connections from before this change keep working for the connecter — but other org members won't auto-resolve to them. To promote a user-scope connection to org-shared, the owner/admin disconnects and reconnects once in the affected app.

- dca4f6d: Domain-based org join across the framework — three connected changes so a fresh signup whose email matches an existing org's `allowed_domain` lands inside that org without manual steps:
  - **Auto-join on signup.** New `autoJoinDomainMatchingOrgs(email)` helper, called from the Better Auth `user.create.after` hook. Anyone who signs up with an email whose domain matches `organizations.allowed_domain` is added to that org as a `member` immediately, and `active-org-id` is set to it (only when the user doesn't already have an active org from a pending invite). Idempotent and missing-table-safe.
  - **OrgSwitcher popover** now renders a "Join your team" section listing every domain-match org with a one-click Join button, for users who signed up before the org existed (or whose auto-join failed). Wires through `useJoinByDomain`.
  - **InvitationBanner** also renders domain-match orgs as a top-of-app prompt, so existing-but-not-yet-joined users see a clear CTA without needing to open the picker.

  The backend (`organizations.allowed_domain`, `getMyOrgHandler.domainMatches`, `joinByDomainHandler`, `useJoinByDomain`) was already in place — these changes wire it into the signup flow and the prominent UIs.

### Patch Changes

- dca4f6d: Improve agent chat setup and auth recovery by routing missing provider setup to Builder.io and surfacing hosted sign-in for authentication failures.
- dca4f6d: Replace native title hints on interactive controls with shadcn tooltips.
- dca4f6d: Resolve agent engine status against the active request user so per-user provider secrets are detected correctly.
- a1fef80: Add [dev-session] log when auto-binding email in CLI runner; fix TS narrowing in db-reset-dev-owner; remove redundant trim in zeroChangesHint.
- 117d476: Harden GitHub design-token imports with token-aware fetch helpers and keep persisted agent run diagnostics longer for reconnect investigation.
- dca4f6d: Keep agent chat auto-recovery alive across long runs that keep making progress.
- dca4f6d: Dedupe collaborative presence avatars by email and show collaborator emails on hover.
- dca4f6d: Smooth signup email verification handoff back into the app.

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 3424455: Fix `agent-native create` failing with "Unrecognized archive format" on freshly published versions. The CLI now tries the changesets per-package tag (`@agent-native/core@<version>`) first, falls back to the legacy `v<version>` tag, and finally to `main` — so it keeps working through the release-tag scheme shift introduced when the framework adopted changesets.
- 81005c4: Add an optional AgentPanel chat notice render slot.
- 81005c4: Export a reusable client theme initialization script helper.
- 81005c4: Avoid stale Vite prebundles for core source aliases in monorepo development.
- 81005c4: Initialize template light/dark classes before hydration and normalize legacy theme storage.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- e3a8798: Recover agent chat runs automatically when streams time out, disconnect, or stay open without producing progress.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e375642: Add `@agent-native/core/usage` subpath export for `getUsageSummary` so server-side consumers (Cloudflare Workers / Pages) can import it without hitting the curated browser entry. Switch dispatch's usage-metrics store to the new subpath, fixing the dispatch CF Pages build failure.

### Patch Changes

- bcb2069: Hide partial assistant text from transient agent-chat continuations while retaining it as continuation history.
  Recover agent chat streams that stay connected but stop producing progress events.

## 0.7.85

### Patch Changes

- 4e3631b: Add `publishConfig.provenance: true` so `pnpm publish` (called by `changeset publish` from the auto-publish workflow) requests an OIDC token from GitHub Actions and publishes via npm trusted publisher. Without this, `pnpm publish` looked for token-based auth and failed with `ENEEDAUTH`.

## 0.7.84

### Patch Changes

- a75a89c: In Builder.io's editor frame, `sendToAgentChat` now keeps content prompts self-targeted so the embedded app's own `AgentSidebar` receives them. Code requests still delegate to Builder via `builder.submitChat`. Drops the explicit `isInBuilderFrame()` branching from dispatch's home composer — the routing now lives in core.
- a75a89c: Add Dispatch workspace usage metrics and preserve app ids in token usage rows.
- a75a89c: Recommend Dispatch more clearly during workspace scaffolding and add a packaged Dispatch extension API for workspace-owned tabs.
- a75a89c: Add server-side 302 redirect from `/tools` and `/tools/:id` page routes to `/extensions/...` so existing bookmarks for the renamed primitive keep working. Honors `APP_BASE_PATH` for workspace deployments.
